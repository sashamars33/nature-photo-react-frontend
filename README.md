# nature-photo-react-frontend
Frontend interface for an API that has photos of nature, plants, landscapes, etc.

The API for this application can be found at this repository: https://github.com/sashamars33/nature-photo-generator-2.0

An API for that returns images of natural areas. You too can have random nature photos on your website! To access the api use the url: https://enthusiastic-crab-windbreaker.cyclic.app/api

If you like a specific photo you can access it by using: https://enthusiastic-crab-windbreaker.cyclic.app/api/number . Each photo has a corrisponding number displayed on the generating screen.

I try and add new photos when I can so check back for new photos!

Link to project: [vist here](https://nature-photo-generator.netlify.app/)

Tech used: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, REST apis

Optimizations: Im looking to add a swatch functionality to the site that utilizes html canvas.
